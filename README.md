# About TalentLayer

TalentLayer is composable, decentralized, open-source infrastructure for talent markets; allowing anyone to easily build interoperable gig marketplaces. It is designed to empower workers to own their own reputation and access jobs without limitation. **TalentLayer’s Alpha is currently in development.**

TalentLayer creates a paradigm shift in how freelance marketplaces operate by creating a universal reputation system and jobs repository that any marketplace can tap into. Users maintain one self-owned reputation across many marketplaces. Marketplaces that build on TalentLayer receive rewards by onboarding talent and jobs.

TalentLayer's architecture provides marketplaces with the most important backend components to get started, allowing marketplaces to be built rapidly, with a stronger focus on great UI/UX design…

# Integrating TalentLayer into Your Platform

TalentLayer is currently pre-Alpha. The TalentLayer ID Universal Reputation System and TalentLayer Universal Jobs Repo are live in MVP status on Gnosis mainnet and ETH's Kovan testnet, with full smart contracts and searchable graph available for integration today. 

*At this point, our team will work directly with integrating platforms engineers to ensure things go smoothly! We are currently working to expand our documentation going forward, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.*

*If you are interested in using TalentLayer's contracts on another chain or L2, we are down to help deploy elsewhere in a way that keeps implementations on each chain referegcable for all integrated platforms. Please recach out to us at kirsten@talentlayer.org*
