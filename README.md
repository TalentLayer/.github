# About TalentLayer

TalentLayer is composable, decentralized, open-source infrastructure for talent markets; allowing anyone to easily build interoperable gig marketplaces. It is designed to empower workers to own their own reputation and access jobs without limitation. **TalentLayer’s Alpha is currently in development.**

TalentLayer creates a paradigm shift in how freelance marketplaces operate by creating a universal reputation system and jobs repository that any marketplace can tap into. Users maintain one self-owned reputation across many marketplaces. Marketplaces that build on TalentLayer receive rewards by onboarding talent and jobs.

TalentLayer's architecture provides marketplaces with the most important backend components to get started, allowing marketplaces to be built rapidly, with a stronger focus on great UI/UX design…

# About Indie (AKA “TalentLayer Indie”)

TalentLayer Indie is a demo tool that was built on TalentLayer. TalentLayer Indie is the first implementation of the TalentLayer Protocol, a decentralized backend for talent marketplaces and sovereign work reputation system. It serves as an example of what can be built using TalentLayer, and is available for forking on Github!

Indie is styled as a reputation tool for independent freelancers. Similar to how you can build up a reputation over time by completing work and receiving reviews on freelancing platforms like Upwork or Freelancer.com, now you and your independent clients can create verified reviews to signal one another’s trustworthiness.
